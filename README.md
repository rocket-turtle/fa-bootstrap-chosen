# Fa-bootstrap-chosen
The fa-bootstrap-chosen is a CSS-style with that you can use the popular [chosen](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/) library with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

It is inspired by [bootstrap-chosen](https://github.com/alxlit/bootstrap-chosen).

# Example
[See it in action.](http://rocket-turtle.github.io/fa-bootstrap-chosen)

# Why would you use fa-bootstrap-chosen style?
There are a couple of styles out there but this one fully builds on the Bootstrap variables.
If you include it as .scss file in the build process of your application you can use any Bootstrap theme you like or even build your own.

It supports Bootstrap styles for:
- Font size
- Input background color
- Input border radius
- Focus colors and transition
- Validation states

# SCSS support
To get the best results include the fa-bootstrap-chosen.scss in your project.
Because fa-bootstrap-chosen is based on bootstrap you need to provide bootstrap/variables.less and bootstrap/mixins.less.
